# Create Engineers - Season 7 (Forge)
## About
All the datapacks included in the __Create Engineers__ server during __Season 7 (Forge)__.

The main goal of this season was to add a more __RPG__ feel to the standard Create experience and as such, the main origins were kept simplistic with little changes to gameplay while the classes were the main focus.

~~Classes now have upgrades as well as special perks which can be unlocked with skill points earned through various tasks specific to the class the player is using.~~

> __NOTE:__ The leveling system broke during the transition from Fabric to Forge and as such, a major part of the datapack is lacking compared to the Fabric version.

## Trivia
- The __Cheeseman__ origin is still included in this season of the server as an easter egg from __Season 6__ however it is unobtainable without the use of commands
- All the classes are nearly identical to the ones in the `Origins: Classes` addon, they just got tweaked
- The Vulpen origin was suggested by __EaglePlayzzYT ("Sprocket")__
- The __Rider__ class was planned to be another class in __Season 6__ but it was delayed and eventually cancelled. It has made it's return, now with even more features than planned previously!
- The __Contractor__ class was suggested and playtested by __CreateRageGames__
- The main datapack also includes a playtime counter which you can access with `/trigger playtime`
